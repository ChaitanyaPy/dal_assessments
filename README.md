## What is this?
This is basically an online platform for conducting assessments. It allows conducting assessments in MCQ format. On completing a test, it returns the final test score and saves a detailed record of the test stream which includes data like question sequence, difficulty modulation, average time, total time, etc.

## Why is this special?
This is not just an ordinary software for conducting assessments like Google Forms. We have applied a few simple algorithms to make each test uniquely adapt the person attending it. It automatically adjusts the difficulty of the upcoming questions to allow the student to learn from their mistakes in a uniform fashion.
